# Fantom 08 Complete Tutorial Roadmap — Batches C through H

> **Status:** Saved for future execution. All 27 existing tutorials (Batches A+B) complete.

## Context

We have **27 tutorials** covering **34/34 screen types** (100% screen coverage). But screen coverage ≠ feature coverage. A deep page-by-page review of the full 185-page reference manual identified **61 uncovered features** that a new user needs to learn.

This plan adds **27 new tutorials** organized into **6 batches**, bringing the total to **54 tutorials** — comprehensive coverage of virtually every user-facing Fantom 08 capability.

## Implementation Approach

Same proven workflow from Batches A & B:
1. **PRE-BUILD gate** — Read specific manual PDF pages, cross-reference, verify control IDs
2. **Write tutorial** — Follow `split-keyboard-zones.ts` structure, cumulative panel state
3. **Register** — index.ts import + array + named export
4. **Update tests** — Increment count, add step count
5. **POST-BUILD gate** — `npm run test`, `npm run build`
6. **Code review** after each batch
7. **Commit** per tutorial

### Files Modified Per Tutorial
- Create: `src/data/tutorials/fantom-08/<name>.ts`
- Modify: `src/data/tutorials/fantom-08/index.ts`
- Modify: `src/__tests__/tutorials/fantom08Tutorials.test.ts`

No new screen types expected — all 34 already exist and are registered.

## Priority Recommendation

If doing all 6 batches at once is too much, prioritize:

1. **Batch C (MIDI)** — Highest priority. Entire category is empty. MIDI is core to any keyboard.
2. **Batch E (Tone Engines)** — High. Users need to edit VTW organs, drum kits, pianos differently.
3. **Batch D (Sequencer + Vocoder)** — High. Step recording and TR-REC are fundamental workflows.
4. **Batch F (Performance)** — Medium-High. Search, pad modes, and velocity layers matter for daily use.
5. **Batch G (Advanced Sampling)** — Medium. Power user features.
6. **Batch H (System/Files)** — Medium. Important but less exciting. Backup/restore is essential though.
